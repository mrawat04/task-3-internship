INTRODUCTION
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of retail sales data, specifically focusing on Walmart store performance across different locations. Using Python for data exploration and visualization, I aim to uncover insights into sales trends, seasonal variations, and the influence of external factors like holidays, temperature, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment rates. Through this analysis, I aim to provide actionable insights for retail management decision-making and enhance understanding of consumer behavior and market dynamics.

**Summary of the Dataset:**
1.	Store: Identifier for the retail store.
2.	Date: Date of sales record.
3.	Holiday_Flag: Indicator for holiday week (1) or non-holiday week (0).
4.	Temperature: Temperature in the region of the store.
5.	Fuel_Price: Fuel price in the region.
6.	CPI: Consumer Price Index.
7.	Unemployment: Unemployment rate.


**Walmart Sales Analysis â€“ Holiday Impact & External Factors
Project Overview**

This project analyzes Walmart weekly sales data to evaluate the impact of holiday weeks and external factors (Temperature, Fuel, CPI, Unemployment) on sales performance. The goal is to provide actionable insights through KPI visualization, trend analysis, and correlation assessment.

**Key Metrics & Measures****
1. Holiday Sales KPI

Measure: % Sales Increase on Holidays

Formula:

Calculate average weekly sales for Holiday vs Non-Holiday weeks.

KPI shows relative increase/decrease.

Insight: Holiday weeks outperform non-holiday weeks by X%, highlighting seasonal impact.

2. Weekly Sales Trend

Insight: Peaks in sales coincide with holiday periods, indicating seasonality.

3. External Factor Correlation

Method:

Key Influencers visual or correlation table to evaluate influence of Temperature, Fuel, CPI, and Unemployment.

Insights:

Temperature positively correlates with sales.

Fuel, CPI, and Unemployment show minor or negligible short-term effects.

4. Holiday vs Non-Holiday Comparison

Insight: Highlights the contribution of holiday weeks to overall sales performance.

**Actionable Insights**

Focus marketing and inventory on high-impact holiday weeks.

Temperature is a significant driver of sales; plan seasonal product promotions accordingly.

Macro factors like Fuel, CPI, and Unemployment have limited short-term impact on weekly sales.
